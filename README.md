# tree2
Enhanced version of Windows tree.exe command

`tree2 [drive:][path] [/F] [/A] [/W] [/2]`

* /F   Display the names of the files in each folder
* /A   Use ASCII instead of extended characters.
* /W   Produce output suitable for a static HTML web page.
* /2   Indent by 2 instead of 4.

The two switches that this version adds to the Windows utility are /W and /2.  The /W switch produces a single web page that displays a tree view of the directory structure - similar to the folder viewers of file managers.
